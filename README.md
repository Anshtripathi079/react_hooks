# React Hooks

Hooks were added to React in version 16.8.

Hooks allow function components to have access to state and other React features. Because of this, class components are generally no longer needed.

### Hook Rules
There are 3 rules for hooks:

- Hooks can only be called inside React function components.
- Hooks can only be called at the top level of a component.
- Hooks cannot be conditional.

### React useState Hook
The React useState Hook allows us to track state in a function component.

State generally refers to data or properties that need to be tracking in an application.

#### Import useState
To use the useState Hook, we first need to import it into our component.
```javascript
import { useState } from "react";
```
